1- REQUIREMENTS
====================
The program depends on pyglet, so you have to install it. I used the packaged one for Ubuntu 10.10 
$sudo apt-get install python-pyglet

Python is cross platform, however, I did not test the code on other platform than linux.

2- DOWNLOAD
====================
To download the program try to copy paste the below link to your browser
https://github.com/aboSamoor/CompGeometry/zipball/master

It is preferred to clone or checkout the git branch
$ git clone git://github.com/aboSamoor/CompGeometry.git


3- RUNNING
====================
$python main.py

This will launch a new window, where you can draw the polygons, lines, vertices you like. To start the algorithm you have to press 'x'. This will progress the sweepin algorithm
one event per key. It is advised not to modify the polygons or add lines once you start the algorithm.

If you already have a polygon or bunch of lines expressed in a file, then you can initialize the window with that drawing by passing the name of the file after the 'f' flag
$python main.py -f fileName

If the file extension is .p the file will be interpreted as polygon making a line between every two consectuitive vertices. If the file extension is .l the file will be
interpreted as a sequence of line that are defined by pairs of vertices.

Example:

Polygon.p: which is a triangle
0,0
50,50
25,75

Polygon.l: the same triangle expressed as sequence of lines
0,0
50,50
50,50
25,75
0,0
25,75

You can generate random polygons using the script provided:
$randomPolygonGenerator.py sizeOfyourPolygon

4- Limitations
====================

The program do not quit once it discovers the first crossing, however, this can be add easily. More testing should be done, so bug reports are welcome.
